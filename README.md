# Inspiration âœ¨
We see github Users  with more than 500 projects and there were more than 100/200/1000 open issues in each of them, So we think that the platform which helps them to organize the issues and see new ones will be great.Not only for them, but also for open source Contributors, who want to contribute for big repositories.

# What it does ðŸ¤–

 StalkGit is a web app that uses GitHub API to fetch user data from the GitHub database and display a user's information including the number of public repositories and other data on the user.
# Key features ðŸ’¡

## Curent 
For now our demo application contains single-page web site where it is possible to simple find the user, information on Github and all of repositories.

## Future plans
As we mentioned , Our purpose is to make Open-Source developer's life easier. So, on our website besides current features, we are going to add open issues managemenet system.It will be a possible to find User with some tags (like language , datetime). Open source developer can find all of the open issues on her/his or someone else profile with some filtered options (most common datetime option). So, it will be possible to easily check all of the new issues. 

# Novelty ðŸ’Ž

# Tech Stack ðŸ“š

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React
- React-Redux Toolkit
- Tailwind CSS
- Git, Github

# Future scope's technical descriptionðŸ“ˆ

We are using Gihub API. For now Githuáƒ‘ API doesn't contains kind of request options we need. 
## Finding all of the open issues 
 After finding all of the open repositories with :  
 ``` javascript
 const fetchReposAction = createAsyncThunk(
  "repos/list",
  async (user, { rejectWithValue, getState, dispatch }) => {
    try {
      const { data } = await axios.get(
        `https://api.github.com/users/${user}/repos?per_page=700&sort=asc`,

      );
 ``` 
 this request . we need to find all of the open issues inside of them . So we are going to use  allSettled option react. 

 ``` javascript
const promiseArr = allRepos
.map((id) => fetch (`https://api.github.com/users/${user}/${repo}/issues?per_page=700&sort=asc`))

const res = await Promise.allSettled(promiseArr)
.filter(<possible filters with date and repository language and etc>)

 ```
In that way we will find all issues inside repos and write helfuL UI/UX for this add on.
